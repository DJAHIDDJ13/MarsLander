# Playing with a mars lander simulation and genetic algorithms

## TODO

- Maybe implement a simplified 1D quadtree (on x axis only) to further optimize
- Retry the genetic alg with the improved sim
- Try a genetic alg to select Neural Networks instead
- Retry the DQN training with the improved sim
- Convert the direction vector from cartesian to polar coordinates
